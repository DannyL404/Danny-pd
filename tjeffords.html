    <br><font face="Acme" size="5" color="white"> Sgt Terry Jeffords is a main character of the show. He is often submissive and won’t do anything dangerous as he is terrified of something going wrong and not being there for his daughters. He was always very overweight and bullied for it, he had a rough childhood and a very strict father. During his childhood he loved the books of DC Parlov and viewed police officers as superheroes. He joined the police force because he always wanted to be a superhero. Terry has a love for yoghurt and is often joked about in the show how the way to get him to do stuff is through yoghurts. He also addresses himself as “Terry”, which is a running gag. He is very protective of the squad and is a very hardworking individual, he often goes the extra mile for people and hates the idea of someone disliking him. He is a very good cop and a serious person however is also very smooth. The squad view him as a father figure. He will always back his squad and will try his hardest to make things work for them even if it’s a lot of work. Despite all this he has a ferocious temper, he gets furious when the squad don’t include him in stuff, or when people try to challenge the ability of his colleagues, due to his massive strength his temper often ends up with him destroying stuff, for example ripping a whole boot in half and lots of smashed windows.  </font></br>
