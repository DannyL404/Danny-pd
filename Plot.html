</center>
<br><br>
<center>
<font face="Acme" size="6" color="white">This page is a brief summary of the show, however to get the best of the show I reccomend watching this. <br> If you have seen the show and think that this is very vague, because I tried not to include any spoilers.</font>
</center>
<br><br>
<font face="Acme" size="5" color="white">The characters differences and relationships with each other allow for the hilarious workplace comedy to work so perfectly (For detailed information on the main characters, visit the character page of this website). Captain Holt arrives right at the start of the show and is the new captain of the precinct. This allows for the show to make sure that we are introduced to the characters properly as if we were him. The characters are all already close and have their own quirks that get shown as Captain Holt discovers them. Despite this we lean little about captain Holt because he is a very contained character. We start the journey of the show by seeing Amy and Jake having a highly competitive bet about who can arrest the most perps. The bet makes both the detectives act slightly out of regulations, especially Jake as he does not care for rules. Captain Holt arrives and is not happy about this and starts being very strict on the whole precinct, although on Jake the most as he is the least rule abiding. Despite this all the detectives respect him very quickly and follow his command almost immediately, apart from Jake initially but a few episodes in he became compliant. All the detectives start working together to make the Brooklyn area safer and less full of crime, and they are good as a team, making many arrests. However, the program is more about the people behind this, whilst you do see arrests you see more after hoursâ€™ time in the bar, karaoke and the relationships between the characters. </font>
<br>
<font face="Acme" size="5" color="white">There are often shenanigans that cause arguments and divides in the characters; however, their relationships are so close that they never fall apart and fall out for more than a few episodes and they always make up. This shows the relationships that they have are very complex and so vast and long lasting that it would take a lot to happen for them to be permanently broken or damaged. </font>
